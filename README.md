This is a repository that allows the exploration of possible edits and updates to the [Humanist Manifesto](https://americanhumanist.org/what-is-humanism/manifesto3/), which is expected to be an evolving document.

This is not the repository of the official version, but merely place where it can evolve using modern paradigms of knowledge generation

* open-ness (anyone can fork this and suggest changes through a pull request)
* transparency (we will track changes over time and they will be easy to see)

The latest iteration is stored in latest.md
